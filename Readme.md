<h1>run_analysis.R</h1>
<p>The run_analysis.R script does the following:
<ol>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. </li>
<li>From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
